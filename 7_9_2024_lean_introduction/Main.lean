Tactics cheatsheet:
  - `rw [<theorem1>, <theorem2>]` to use theorems of the form `a = b` to rewrite the goal.
  - `calc a = b := by ...
          _ = c := by ...` to prove that `a = c` with intermediate steps in between.
  - `ring` to automatically prove equalities that involve basic algebra simplification without division.
  - `linarith` to automatically prove equality or inequalities that involve addition, subtraction, and multiplication by constants
  - `simp` to automatically prove equalities by reducing both sides to their "simplest" form
  - `rel [<theorem1>, <theorem2>]` to prove `a ≤ c` by using theorems like `a ≤ b` and `b ≤ c`.
  - `exact <theorem>` to finish the proof using theorem.
  - `by_contra <hypothesis>` convert the proof to a contradiction proof and insert the negation of the conclusion as a hypothesis.
  - `done` is a placeholder tactic you can use at the end of a proof to indicate all goals are solved.

  Logical connectives:
  - Iff is ↔ and you use `apply Iff.intro` in order to split the goal into two cases, the forward direction (`mp` for `modus ponens`) and the backwards direction (`mpr` for `modus ponens reverse`).
  - To prove that `p → q`, use `intro h` to make `p` a hypothesis and then prove `q` from there.
